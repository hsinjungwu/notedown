NoteDown
========

A simple editor for myself.

##How to Use

1. Write your note in [markdown][^1] (sample `notedown.md` maybe help)
2. Save it in the folder of **notedown.exe** and name it as *notedown.md* 
3. Run **notedown.exe**

##Feature

- HotKey
    - `ctrl` + `S` : Save File
    - `Esc` : Close Application (errrrr... only right part is focused, maybe fixed some day)
- Highlight
    - Click treenode of left side, the header will be trigger
    - Keyword (errrrr... I only add `int`, `double` and `decimal`)
    - Markdown format (errrrr, only for `#Header1`, `##Header2`, `**bolid**`, `*italic*`, ```plaintext```)

##Future Work

Maybe no future..... lol
